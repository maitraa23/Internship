2003,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it,3
2004,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
2005,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .,4

2234,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
2235,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful.

2504,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
2505,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

2764,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
2765,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful.

3034,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
3035,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

3294,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
3295,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful.

3564,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
3565,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

3824,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
3825,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .,4

4094,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
4095,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

4354,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
4355,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .,4

4624,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
4625,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

4884,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
4885,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful.

5153,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it,3
5154,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
5155,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

5414,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
5415,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful.

5684,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
5685,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12.

The best phone for this price......",5
5943,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it,3
5944,Very nice phone. Value for money. camera 📸 is too much excellent 👌. Battery 🔋 fast charging with in 10min. 33w fast charger very good.,5
5945,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .,4
